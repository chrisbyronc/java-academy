Retrospective for Last Week's Capstone!

What went well?

1. Had something functional
2. Practice makes perfect
3. Having a rubber ducky, or a friend to help
4. Looking back at previous weeks, makes more sense after capstone

What went poorly or could have been done differently?

1. Dive into new concepts based on research for features in the project
2. Focus on the harder parts first, could have been more beneficial to tackle early to focus on the easier parts first
3. Getting comfortable changing what you've done
4. Challenge self more
5. Prioritizing minor bugs over major features/bugs
6. Work to understand a concept more before implementation (Dates and Formatting Dates)

What do you want to continue doing?

1. Using project boards to track work
2. Revising code daily after project is done
3. Seeing others solutions to address how "we" solve our own problems

What did you learn today?

1. Default Access Modifier
   1. by default class properties/methods are private
2. Derived Getters
   1. retrieving values from properties
3. Calculated Getters
   1. returns not based off of defined property
   2. Calculating the response
   3. Add/Subtract/Concat anything
4. Boolean getter
   1. returns true or false
   2. uses "is" prefix
5. Cohesion
   1. high cohesion is preferred
   2. High cohesion - tightly related
   3. Low cohesion - unrelated information grouped
6. instantiate means to create an instance of
