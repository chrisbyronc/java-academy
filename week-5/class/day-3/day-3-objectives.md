What did you learn yesterday?

1. Static - will review in the afternoon
2. Overloading methods
   1. We can use the same name, and different parameters
   2. same name, different parameters
   3. What are the benefits of overloading?
      1. Conserve namespace
      2. Reduces duplication of set response
      3. In case we don't have all the data yet? - constructor 
      4. Improved readability
      5. Avoiding redundancy
      6. Flexibility for future cases
3. Overloading constructor
   1. prepping for future uses
   2. handling different cases with or without parameters
4. Comparators
