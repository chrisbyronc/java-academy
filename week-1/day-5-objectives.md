   2. else - default response, when none of conditions are true
   3. else is not required with an if
   4. runs if true (bool)
   5. !true/!false/!= - not true/not false/not equal to
   6. && - and, both values must be true
   7. || - or, either value must be true
   8. == is for comparison - compares the reference, not the value
   9. String.equals()
2. booleans
3. methods
   1. void method - returns nothing
   2. int methodName()
4. DRY - do not repeat yourself
5. importing scanner (tool) all the classes
6. shortcuts
   1. sout + tab - for system out println
   2. main + tab - for main method declaration
7. scanner class
   1. Scanner keyboardInput = new Scanner(System.in)
   2. gives ability to collect input from a user

   4. scanner.nextInt()
   5. when using println, can use only scanner.nextLine() without setting a variable to 'consume' the CRLF values
8. string print
   1.  System.out.print() does not include CRLF
   2.  System.out.println() includes CRLF
   3.  formatting strings with printf
