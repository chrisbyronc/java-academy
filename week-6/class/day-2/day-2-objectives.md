Icebreaker: What's your favorite fall activity?

What did we learn yesterday?

1. Inheritance
   1. extends classes into class
      1. public and protected methods and properties are passed to child class
   2. protected access modifier lets child classes have access
   3. private access modifier is not available in child
   4. super() in child, calls constructor in parent
2. DRY: Don't repeat yourself
