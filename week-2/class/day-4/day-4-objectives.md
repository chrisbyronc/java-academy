What did you learn yesterday?

1. Arrays - list of values
   1. all the same type, single variable type
   2. index starts at 0
   3. exArr[int]
   4. have a fixed length - can't modify the length
   5. Arrays.sort(exArr); - organize in natural ordering of elements asc/ascending 
   6. .length - no parens, this is a property
   7. Arrays.clone() - clones values from one array into another
   8. attempting to copy, is going reference/point to the original array
2. loops - repeated execution of a code block, continuous action
   1. while (condition) { //code block }
      1. repeats as long as condition is true
   2. do while (condition) { //code block }
      1. always runs once, will continue if condition is true
   3. for (declare iterator variable, condition, updating the iterator)
      1. meets condition, which means the condition can update
      2. typically used for incrementing/decrementing (iterating) values
   4. for each
      1. used for Arrays
      2. for (Type values_from_array : arrName)
      3. no access to the index
3. Delimiter
   1. thing that separates
4. default values of data types
   1. int = 0
   2. String = null
