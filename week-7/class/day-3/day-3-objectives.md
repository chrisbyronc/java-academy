What did you learn today?

1. streams
   1. filter - expects bool
2. kinda streams better at organization
3. List is parent of ArrayList
4. I learned that the reduce operation is used to combine elements of a stream into a single result. When working with objects and desiring to reduce them to a primitive type (such as int), you need to use the mapToInt operation to convert the stream to a specialized IntStream.
5. using variables in forEach are final
6. :: method references
