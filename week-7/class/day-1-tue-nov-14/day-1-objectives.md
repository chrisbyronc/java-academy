What did you learn today?

1. interfaces
      1. `public class Example extends ParentClass implements ExampleInterface, SecondExInterface`
   1. defining interactions for classes
   2. Anything that implements, must use the collection of methods
   3. 'default' keyword used for default methods in interface
   4. @Override - used to help override methods in children, tells compiler we are overriding
      1. throws error if not method to be overridden
2. generics - non specific
   1. Placeholder for any type
   2. Allows flexibility with our classes
   3. <> - syntax defining a generic
